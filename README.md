- 👋 Hi, I’m @rekosbar
- 👀 I’m interested in learning what is GitHub and how it works and (hopefully) get into technical writing. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JSON and XML for tech writers.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some project where I could help write technical documentation. I already know a thing or two ;)
- 📫 How to reach me - well I guess you can leave me a message here, or send an email: rekosiewicz@gmail.com

Cheers!
